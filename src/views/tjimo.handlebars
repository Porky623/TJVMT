    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-left mb-4">What is TJIMO?</h2>
    <p class="mb-10">
        The Thomas Jefferson Intermediate Math Open (TJIMO) is a contest that the Thomas Jefferson Varisty Math Team holds for middle schools in the
        Washington, DC area. Students learn a variety of problem-solving strategies from experienced VMT student coaches and apply these strategies in a mathematics competition.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-left mb-4">How Does the Contest Work?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">TJIMO consists of four rounds of tests that challenge students' mathematical problem solving skills. A large block of the event is dedicated to coaching,
        in which students are assigned to small groups and learn strategies from VMT student coaches. See below for more details on each round.</p>
    <ul class="mb-10 px-5 list-disc">
        <li><span class="font-bold">Individual Round</span>: The individual round is a one hour 30 problem round modeled after MATHCOUNTS' sprint round. Top scorers in the individual round
            will recieve awards at the end of the event. Scores from this round is also used to create balanced teams for the later rounds.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Coaching</span>: After the individual round, students will be assigned to small groups and be coached by VMT members.
            They will be able to go over problems from the individual round and learn new strategies that will help in the team rounds later.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Team and Power Rounds</span>: The team and power rounds consists of harder problems in different formats based on those seen in college math competitions.
            Students will be given sample rounds during coaching to familarize themselves with the format and learn how to write formal proofs.
        <li><span class="font-bold">Guts Round</span>: The guts round is a special team round in which students are given several consecutive sets of problems and try to solve them as fast as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-left mb-4">FAQ</h2>
    <p class="mb-10">
        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: Who can participate?<br/>

        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: Who can register?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: ONE math teacher or math team coordinator from each school can register students from their school to participate in TJIMO. Students may not register themselves individually. <br/><br/>
        
        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: How many students can attend from a school?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: Up to 7.<br/><br/>

        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: Can students leave early?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: All students must be able to attend the entirety of TJIMO.<br/><br/>

        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: Do school sponsors have to stay for the entirety of TJIMO?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: Sponsors are allowed to switch out as long as at least one school sponsor is at TJIMO at all times.<br/><br/>
        
        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: What is the role of the teacher/coordinator?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: The role of the teacher/coordinator is simply being the link between us, the organizers, and the students - an essential role in the virtual environment. In other words, they will be responsible for making sure the students are at the right place at the right time and relaying information to students.<br/><br/>
        
        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: Will students from the same school compete as a team?<br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: No, students will be assigned to teams balanced by math level during the individual round.<br/><br/>
        
        <span class="font-bold">Q</span>: What will students need for the competition? <br/>
        <span class="font-bold">A</span>: Pencils, paper, and a mindset to learn!
